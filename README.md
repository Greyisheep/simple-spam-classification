# Email Spam Classification Using NLP

## Overview
This repository implements an email spam classification system using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains raw and processed data files.
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing, training, and prediction.
- `models/`: Model creation, training, saving, and loading.
- `tests/`: Unit tests for the codebase.
- `main.py`: Main script to run the pipeline.

## Getting Started
1. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

2. Train the model:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. Predict a new email:
    ```bash
    python main.py
